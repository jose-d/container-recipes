  # this is to avoid message "setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.utf-8)" after clean install of CentOS8
  dnf install --assumeyes langpacks-en glibc-all-langpacks wget vim curl python3 git

  python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
  python3 -m pip install --upgrade jupyterhub
  python3 -m pip install --upgrade notebook
  python3 -m pip install --upgrade pandas numpy pytest ipython ipywidgets ipython matplotlib
  

  # there is major difference between batchspawner available in pip and the version at github.. So we clone the version from gh:
  #
  #python3 -m pip install --upgrade batchspawner
  git clone https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner.git
  cd batchspawner
  pip install -e .

%environment

  # this is to have binaries from pip available in PATH
  export PATH="~/.local/bin":$PATH
